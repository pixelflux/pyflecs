# PyFlecs
PyFlecs is a Python wrapper around the Flecs library: 
https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs. The goal is to provide access to the 
flecs ECS library, while providing similar C-speeds within Python. This is
handled through the use of numpy arrays for all components.

This project is very much a work in progress.
